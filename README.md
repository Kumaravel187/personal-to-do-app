# ToDo App Project

This is a simple web application that allows me to manage my tasks and to-do items. The app is built using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript, and it utilizes LocalStorage as a simple database to store your tasks.

## Features

- Add new tasks with descriptions and due dates.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Edit task details.
- Delete tasks.
- Store tasks locally using LocalStorage.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

todo-app/

- `app/`: Directory containing JavaScript files.
  - `app.js`: Contains the main app logic and interaction.
- `styles/`: Directory containing CSS and SCSS files for styling.
  - `style.css`: Compiled CSS file.
  - `style.scss`: SCSS source file.
  - `style.css.map`: Source map for SCSS to CSS mapping.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the app.
- `readme.md`: The README file containing project information and instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Start adding, editing, and managing your tasks!

## LocalStorage Usage

The app uses LocalStorage to store your tasks locally in the browser. This means your tasks will persist even after you close the app. However, please note that LocalStorage has its limitations, such as a relatively small storage capacity (~5-10MB per domain) and data being stored as strings.
